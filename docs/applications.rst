Anomaly Detection 
======================



KeplerMapper can be used for anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is useful for fighting fraud and finding errors. Projecting with ``knn_distance_5`` can surface outliers. There are also specialized outlier detection algorithms, like the Isolation Forest and GLOSH, that make good projections for anomaly detection.
